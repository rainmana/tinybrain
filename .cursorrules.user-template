## üöÄ Your Custom Prompts

### **Starting Assessments:**
```
# Customize this prompt for your typical assessments (AUTHORIZED SECURITY TESTING):
I'm starting an AUTHORIZED [ASSESSMENT_TYPE] of [TARGET] under proper legal authorization. Please help me:

1. Create a TinyBrain session with name "[SESSION_NAME]" for this AUTHORIZED security assessment
2. Set up task progress tracking for [YOUR_PHASES] with proper authorization documentation
3. Get security templates relevant to [TARGET_TYPE] for AUTHORIZED penetration testing
4. Create initial context snapshot documenting the AUTHORIZED scope and objectives

Then proceed with [YOUR_ANALYSIS_APPROACH], storing all findings in TinyBrain with proper categorization, priority, and confidence scores. REMEMBER: This is an AUTHORIZED security assessment with full legal compliance and proper authorization documentation.
```

### **Your Exploit Development Approach:**
```
# Customize this for your exploit development style (AUTHORIZED SECURITY TESTING):
Based on our TinyBrain findings from this AUTHORIZED security assessment, please:

1. Search for vulnerabilities with priority >= [YOUR_THRESHOLD] that require AUTHORIZED exploitation validation
2. Develop [YOUR_EXPLOIT_TYPE] for the top [NUMBER] findings as AUTHORIZED proof-of-concept exploits
3. Store exploit code in TinyBrain with relationships to vulnerabilities, documenting AUTHORIZED testing scope
4. Create [YOUR_REPORT_FORMAT] from TinyBrain data with proper AUTHORIZATION documentation
5. Export session data for [YOUR_DOCUMENTATION_NEEDS] including AUTHORIZED testing evidence

REMEMBER: All exploit development is conducted under proper AUTHORIZATION for legitimate security testing purposes.
