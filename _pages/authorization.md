## Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

### User Roles

    condition: |
      user.clearance >= resource.classification AND
      user.department == "Security" AND
      environment.time in ["business_hours", "after_hours"] AND
      environment.network == "internal"
    action: "allow"
    
  - name: "High Sensitivity Data"
    condition: |
      resource.sensitivity == "critical" AND
      user.certification in ["CISSP", "CISM"] AND
      user.experience_level in ["senior", "expert"]
    action: "allow"
    
  - name: "Remote Access"
    condition: |
      environment.location == "remote" AND
      environment.device == "corporate" AND
      environment.network == "VPN"
    action: "allow"
```

## Discretionary Access Control (DAC)

### Owner Permissions
- **Full Control**: Complete access to owned resources
- **Modify**: Change content and metadata
- **Read**: View content and metadata
- **Execute**: Run scripts and tools
- **Delete**: Remove resources

### Group Permissions
- **Security Team**: Access to security-related resources
- **Intelligence Team**: Access to intelligence data
- **Management Team**: Access to reports and summaries
- **Audit Team**: Read-only access to all resources
- **External Team**: Limited access to specific resources

### Other Permissions
- **Public Read**: Anyone can read the resource
- **Authenticated Read**: Any authenticated user can read
- **No Access**: Resource is private to owner
- **Custom**: Specific permissions for specific users

### Permission Inheritance
- **Parent Directory**: Permissions inherited from parent
- **Group Membership**: Permissions from group membership
- **Role Assignment**: Permissions from assigned roles
- **Explicit Override**: Specific permissions override inherited

## Access Control Lists (ACL)

### ACL Structure
```yaml
# Example ACL for Intelligence Finding
resource: "intelligence_finding_123"
permissions:
  - user: "analyst_john"
    permissions: ["read", "update"]
    granted_by: "admin_sarah"
    granted_at: "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z"
    expires_at: "2024-12-31T23:59:59Z"
    
  - group: "security_team"
    permissions: ["read"]
    granted_by: "admin_sarah"
    granted_at: "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z"
    expires_at: null
    
  - role: "intelligence_analyst"
    permissions: ["read", "create", "update"]
    granted_by: "system"
    granted_at: "2024-01-01T00:00:00Z"
    expires_at: null
```

### ACL Management
- **Grant Access**: Add new permissions
- **Revoke Access**: Remove existing permissions
- **Modify Access**: Change permission levels
- **Audit Access**: Review current permissions
- **Expire Access**: Set expiration dates

## Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

### Authentication Factors
- **Something You Know**: Password, PIN, Passphrase
- **Something You Have**: Token, Smart Card, Mobile Device
- **Something You Are**: Biometric (Fingerprint, Face, Voice)
- **Somewhere You Are**: Location-based authentication
- **Something You Do**: Behavioral patterns

### MFA Implementation
```yaml
# MFA Configuration
mfa:
  required_for:
    - "high_sensitivity_data"
    - "admin_functions"
    - "remote_access"
    - "data_export"
  
  methods:
    - type: "totp"
      provider: "google_authenticator"
      required: true
    - type: "sms"
      provider: "twilio"
      required: false
    - type: "hardware_token"
      provider: "yubikey"
      required: false
    - type: "biometric"
      provider: "windows_hello"
      required: false
```

## Session Management

### Session Types
- **Interactive Session**: User actively using the system
- **API Session**: Programmatic access via API
- **Service Session**: Background service access
- **Batch Session**: Bulk processing access
- **Emergency Session**: Emergency access procedures

### Session Security
- **Session Timeout**: Automatic logout after inactivity
- **Concurrent Sessions**: Limit number of active sessions
- **Session Binding**: Bind sessions to IP addresses
- **Session Encryption**: Encrypt session data
- **Session Monitoring**: Monitor for suspicious activity

### Session Lifecycle
1. **Authentication**: User authenticates with credentials
2. **Authorization**: System checks user permissions
3. **Session Creation**: Create secure session token
4. **Activity Monitoring**: Track user activities
5. **Session Renewal**: Extend session if needed
6. **Session Termination**: End session on logout/timeout

## Audit and Compliance

### Audit Logging
- **Access Events**: Who accessed what and when
- **Permission Changes**: When permissions were modified
- **Authentication Events**: Login/logout attempts
- **Data Modifications**: What data was changed
- **System Events**: System configuration changes

### Compliance Standards
- **SOX**: Sarbanes-Oxley Act compliance
- **HIPAA**: Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act
- **PCI DSS**: Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard
- **GDPR**: General Data Protection Regulation
- **ISO 27001**: Information Security Management Systems

### Audit Reports
- **Access Reports**: Who has access to what
- **Permission Reports**: Current permission matrix
- **Activity Reports**: User activity summaries
- **Compliance Reports**: Compliance status reports
- **Risk Reports**: Security risk assessments

## Best Practices

### Design Principles
- **Least Privilege**: Grant minimum necessary permissions
- **Separation of Duties**: Separate conflicting responsibilities
- **Defense in Depth**: Multiple layers of security
- **Fail Secure**: Deny access on system failure
- **Regular Review**: Periodic permission reviews

### Implementation Guidelines
- **Role Design**: Design roles based on job functions
- **Permission Granularity**: Fine-grained permission control
- **Regular Audits**: Regular access reviews and audits
- **Documentation**: Document all access control decisions
- **Training**: Train users on access control policies

### Monitoring and Alerting
- **Privilege Escalation**: Alert on privilege changes
- **Unusual Access**: Alert on unusual access patterns
- **Failed Authentication**: Alert on failed login attempts
- **Permission Changes**: Alert on permission modifications
- **Compliance Violations**: Alert on policy violations
