# TinyBrain Security Assessment Rules
# Enforces proper use of TinyBrain MCP server for security-focused tasks

## 🧠 MANDATORY: Use TinyBrain for All Security Tasks

### **REQUIRED for Security Code Review:**
- ALWAYS create a TinyBrain session before starting any security assessment
- STORE all findings in TinyBrain with proper categorization (vulnerability, exploit, technique, tool, evidence, recommendation)
- USE priority levels (1-10) and confidence scores (0.0-1.0) for all findings
- CREATE relationships between related vulnerabilities and exploits
- TRACK task progress through assessment stages
- EXPORT session data for documentation

### **REQUIRED for Exploit Development:**
- STORE all exploit code in TinyBrain with category "exploit" or "payload"
- CREATE relationships linking exploits to their corresponding vulnerabilities
- USE semantic search to find similar vulnerabilities across codebases
- GENERATE comprehensive reports from TinyBrain data
- VALIDATE exploits against stored vulnerability information

### **REQUIRED for Penetration Testing:**
- CREATE session for each penetration test engagement
- STORE reconnaissance findings, vulnerabilities, and exploitation results
- TRACK progress through testing phases (recon, scanning, exploitation, post-exploitation)
- USE context snapshots for long-running assessments
- EXPORT findings for client reports

### **REQUIRED for Vulnerability Research:**
- STORE research findings with appropriate categories and metadata
- CREATE relationships between related vulnerabilities and attack vectors
- USE security templates for common vulnerability patterns
- TRACK research progress and findings
- MAINTAIN comprehensive research documentation

## 🚫 PROHIBITED: Anti-Patterns to Avoid

### **NEVER:**
- Store security findings in regular chat without TinyBrain
- Skip categorization and priority scoring
- Forget to create relationships between related findings
- Lose track of assessment progress
- Generate reports without using TinyBrain data
- Ignore duplicate detection and similarity analysis

### **AVOID:**
- Manual tracking of findings outside TinyBrain
- Inconsistent categorization schemes
- Missing metadata (priority, confidence, source)
- Unrelated findings without proper organization
- Reports generated from memory instead of stored data

## 🎯 TinyBrain Usage Patterns

### **Session Management:**
```
ALWAYS start with: create_session
- Name: Descriptive session name
- Task Type: security_review, penetration_test, exploit_dev, vulnerability_analysis, threat_modeling, incident_response
- Description: Clear assessment scope and objectives
```

### **Memory Storage:**
```
ALWAYS use: store_memory
- Category: finding, vulnerability, exploit, payload, technique, tool, reference, context, hypothesis, evidence, recommendation, note
- Priority: 1-10 (10 = critical, 1 = informational)
- Confidence: 0.0-1.0 (1.0 = certain, 0.0 = speculative)
- Tags: Relevant keywords for searchability
- Source: Code file, URL, or reference
```

### **Relationship Creation:**
```
ALWAYS use: create_relationship
- Types: depends_on, causes, mitigates, exploits, references, contradicts, supports, related_to, parent_of, child_of
- Strength: 0.0-1.0 (relationship confidence)
- Description: Clear explanation of relationship
```

### **Progress Tracking:**
```
ALWAYS use: create_task_progress and update_task_progress
- Stages: reconnaissance, vulnerability_discovery, exploitation, post_exploitation, reporting
- Status: pending, in_progress, completed, failed, blocked
- Progress: 0-100 percentage
```

## 🎯 Security Assessment Workflow

### **Phase 1: Setup**
1. Create TinyBrain session
2. Set up task progress tracking
3. Get security templates
4. Create initial context snapshot

### **Phase 2: Discovery**
1. Store findings with proper categorization
2. Create relationships between related issues
3. Update task progress
4. Use semantic search for similar patterns

### **Phase 3: Analysis**
1. Develop exploits for high-priority findings
2. Store exploit code with relationships
3. Check for duplicates and similar issues
4. Generate notifications for critical findings

### **Phase 4: Reporting**
1. Create comprehensive context summary
2. Export session data
3. Generate final security report
4. Validate all findings and relationships

## 🚨 Quality Assurance

### **Before Completing Any Security Task:**
- [ ] All findings stored in TinyBrain
- [ ] Proper categorization and priority scoring
- [ ] Relationships created between related findings
- [ ] Task progress updated
- [ ] High-priority notifications checked
- [ ] Session data exported
- [ ] Comprehensive report generated

### **Validation Checklist:**
- [ ] Session created with proper metadata
- [ ] Memory entries have appropriate categories
- [ ] Priority and confidence scores assigned
- [ ] Relationships established between findings
- [ ] Task progress tracked through stages
- [ ] Exploit code linked to vulnerabilities
- [ ] Duplicate detection performed
- [ ] Final report generated from TinyBrain data

## 🎯 Example Prompts

### **Starting a Security Assessment:**
```
I'm starting a security code review of [TARGET]. Please help me:

1. Create a TinyBrain session for this assessment
2. Set up task progress tracking for the assessment phases
3. Get available security templates
4. Create initial context snapshot

Then proceed with the security analysis, storing all findings in TinyBrain with proper categorization, priority, and confidence scores.
```

### **Developing Exploits:**
```
Based on our TinyBrain findings, please:

1. Search for high-priority vulnerabilities (priority >= 8)
2. Develop proof-of-concept exploits for the top 3 findings
3. Store exploit code in TinyBrain with relationships to vulnerabilities
4. Create comprehensive security report from TinyBrain data
5. Export session data for documentation
```

## 🚀 Success Metrics

### **Minimum Requirements:**
- 1 TinyBrain session created
- 10+ memory entries stored
- 5+ relationships created
- Task progress tracked through all phases
