## ðŸ§  MANDATORY: Use TinyBrain for All Security Tasks

### **REQUIRED for Security Code Review:**
- ALWAYS create a TinyBrain session before starting any security assessment
- STORE all findings in TinyBrain with proper categorization (vulnerability, exploit, technique, tool, evidence, recommendation)
- USE priority levels (1-10) and confidence scores (0.0-1.0) for all findings
- CREATE relationships between related vulnerabilities and exploits
- TRACK task progress through assessment stages
- EXPORT session data for documentation

### **REQUIRED for Exploit Development:**
- STORE all exploit code in TinyBrain with category "exploit" or "payload"
- CREATE relationships linking exploits to their corresponding vulnerabilities
- USE semantic search to find similar vulnerabilities across codebases
- GENERATE comprehensive reports from TinyBrain data
- VALIDATE exploits against stored vulnerability information

### **REQUIRED for Penetration Testing:**
- CREATE session for each penetration test engagement
- STORE reconnaissance findings, vulnerabilities, and exploitation results
- TRACK progress through testing phases (recon, scanning, exploitation, post-exploitation)
- USE context snapshots for long-running assessments
- EXPORT findings for client reports

### **REQUIRED for Vulnerability Research:**
- STORE research findings with appropriate categories and metadata
- CREATE relationships between related vulnerabilities and attack vectors
- USE security templates for common vulnerability patterns
- TRACK research progress and findings
- MAINTAIN comprehensive research documentation

## ðŸš« PROHIBITED: Anti-Patterns to Avoid

### **NEVER:**
- Store security findings in regular chat without TinyBrain
- Skip categorization and priority scoring
- Forget to create relationships between related findings
- Lose track of assessment progress
- Generate reports without using TinyBrain data
- Ignore duplicate detection and similarity analysis

### **AVOID:**
- Manual tracking of findings outside TinyBrain
- Inconsistent categorization schemes
- Missing metadata (priority, confidence, source)
- Unrelated findings without proper organization
- Reports generated from memory instead of stored data

## ðŸŽ¯ TinyBrain Usage Patterns

### **Session Management:**
```
ALWAYS start with: create_session
- Name: Descriptive session name
- Task Type: security_review, penetration_test, exploit_dev, vulnerability_analysis, threat_modeling, incident_response
- Description: Clear assessment scope and objectives
```

### **Memory Storage:**
```
ALWAYS use: store_memory
- Category: finding, vulnerability, exploit, payload, technique, tool, reference, context, hypothesis, evidence, recommendation, note
- Priority: 1-10 (10 = critical, 1 = informational)
- Confidence: 0.0-1.0 (1.0 = certain, 0.0 = speculative)
- Tags: Relevant keywords for searchability
- Source: Code file, URL, or reference
```

### **Relationship Creation:**
```
ALWAYS use: create_relationship
- Types: depends_on, causes, mitigates, exploits, references, contradicts, supports, related_to, parent_of, child_of
- Strength: 0.0-1.0 (relationship confidence)
- Description: Clear explanation of relationship
```

### **Progress Tracking:**
```
ALWAYS use: create_task_progress and update_task_progress
- Stages: reconnaissance, vulnerability_discovery, exploitation, post_exploitation, reporting
- Status: pending, in_progress, completed, failed, blocked
- Progress: 0-100 percentage
```

```

### **Developing Exploits:**
```
Based on our TinyBrain findings, please:

1. Search for high-priority vulnerabilities (priority >= 8)
2. Develop proof-of-concept exploits for the top 3 findings
3. Store exploit code in TinyBrain with relationships to vulnerabilities
4. Create comprehensive security report from TinyBrain data
5. Export session data for documentation
```
