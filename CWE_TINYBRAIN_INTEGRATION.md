## üß† TinyBrain Memory Templates

### **CWE Vulnerability Template:**
```json
{
  "title": "[CWE-XXX] [Vulnerability Name] in [Location]",
  "content": "AUTHORIZED SECURITY ASSESSMENT: [CWE-XXX] vulnerability identified in [LOCATION]. [DETAILED_DESCRIPTION]. EXPLOITATION CONFIRMED: [EXPLOITATION_DETAILS].",
  "category": "vulnerability",
  "priority": "[1-10]",
  "confidence": "[0.0-1.0]",
  "tags": ["[cwe-xxx]", "[vulnerability-type]", "[severity]", "authorized-testing"],
  "source": "authorized-security-assessment",
  "cwe_id": "CWE-XXX",
  "severity": "[critical|high|medium|low]",
  "exploitation_status": "confirmed"
}
```

### **CWE Pattern Template:**
```json
{
  "title": "[CWE-XXX] Pattern - [Pattern Name]",
  "content": "AUTHORIZED SECURITY ASSESSMENT: [CWE-XXX] pattern identified in [LOCATION]. [PATTERN_DESCRIPTION]. SECURITY IMPACT: [IMPACT_ANALYSIS].",
  "category": "technique",
  "priority": "[1-10]",

## üéØ Context-Optimized Usage

### **Avoid Context Overload:**

# ‚úÖ DO: Load by assessment phase
cline "Load injection CWE patterns for current assessment phase"
```

### **Efficient Pattern Matching:**
```bash
# Search for specific vulnerability type
cline "Search TinyBrain for SQL injection patterns (CWE-89) in database interaction code"

# Correlate with existing findings
cline "Find CWE patterns similar to stored vulnerability ID 12345 in TinyBrain"
