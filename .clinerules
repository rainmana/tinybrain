#### **2. Authentication & Session Management**
- **Broken Authentication**: Weak passwords, session fixation, credential stuffing
- **Session Management**: Insecure session tokens, session hijacking
- **Multi-Factor Authentication**: Bypass techniques, implementation flaws
- **OAuth/SAML**: Token manipulation, redirect attacks

#### **3. Authorization & Access Control**
- **Privilege Escalation**: Vertical and horizontal privilege escalation
- **Access Control Bypass**: Direct object references, function-level access control
- **Role-Based Access Control**: RBAC implementation flaws
- **API Authorization**: Missing or weak API authentication/authorization

#### **4. Data Exposure & Information Disclosure**
- **Sensitive Data Exposure**: Unencrypted data, weak encryption
- **Information Disclosure**: Error messages, debug information, stack traces

- **Supply Chain Attacks**: Malicious packages, dependency confusion
- **Third-Party Components**: Vulnerable third-party integrations

#### **7. Logging & Monitoring**
- **Insufficient Logging**: Missing security event logging
- **Log Injection**: Log forging, log injection attacks
- **Monitoring Gaps**: Missing intrusion detection, anomaly detection

### **Exploitation Verification (MANDATORY):**

#### **Proof-of-Concept Development:**
- **ALWAYS** develop working exploits for high-priority findings
- **VALIDATE** vulnerabilities with actual exploitation
- **DOCUMENT** exploitation steps and impact
- **STORE** exploit code in TinyBrain with relationships to vulnerabilities

#### **Exploit Categories:**

### **Phase 2: Vulnerability Discovery**
1. **Static code analysis** for security flaws
2. **Dynamic testing** for runtime vulnerabilities
3. **Manual testing** for business logic flaws
4. **Store vulnerabilities** in TinyBrain with priority scoring

### **Phase 3: Exploitation & Validation**
1. **Develop proof-of-concept exploits** for high-priority findings
2. **Validate vulnerabilities** through actual exploitation
3. **Assess impact** and business risk
4. **Store exploit code** in TinyBrain with relationships

### **Phase 4: Reporting & Documentation**
1. **Generate comprehensive report** from TinyBrain data
2. **Prioritize findings** by risk and impact
3. **Provide remediation guidance** for each vulnerability
4. **Export session data** for client documentation

```bash
#!/bin/bash

    payloads=(
        "; ls -la"
        "| whoami"
        "&& id"
        "; cat /etc/passwd"

    for payload in "${payloads[@]}"; do
        response=$(curl -s "${url}?${parameter}=${payload}")
        if [[ $response == *"root:"* ]] || [[ $response == *"bin:"* ]]; then
