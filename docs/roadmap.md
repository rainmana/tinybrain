- Long-term storage of historical assessments
- Tiered storage options

**Features**:
- Automatic compression based on age or access patterns
- Archive to separate database or file
- Restore archived memories on demand
- Configurable retention policies

### Advanced Analytics and Insights
**Status**: Planned

Provide analytics on security assessment patterns.

**Benefits**:
- Identify common vulnerability patterns
- Track assessment metrics over time
- Benchmark against industry standards
- Generate trend reports

**Capabilities**:
- Vulnerability type distribution
- Time-to-remediation tracking
- Priority/confidence correlations
- Session comparison analytics

### Multi-User Support with Access Controls
**Status**: Planned

Add multi-user capabilities with role-based access control.

**Features**:
- User authentication and authorization
- Session ownership and sharing
- Role-based permissions (read, write, admin)
- Audit logging of user actions
- Team collaboration features

**Security Considerations**:
- Secure credential storage
- Session token management
- Access control enforcement
- Activity logging and monitoring

### Plugin System for Custom Memory Types
**Status**: Planned

Extensible plugin architecture for custom memory types and handlers.

**Benefits**:
- Domain-specific memory types
- Custom validation rules
- Specialized search strategies
- Third-party integrations

**Design**:
- Plugin API specification
- Dynamic plugin loading
- Sandboxed plugin execution
- Plugin registry and discovery

### Integration with Popular Security Tools
**Status**: Planned

Native integrations with common security tools.

**Potential Integrations**:
- Burp Suite (vulnerability import/export)
- Metasploit (exploit tracking)
- Nmap (scan result storage)
- OWASP ZAP (finding correlation)
- GitLab/GitHub Security (CI/CD integration)
- Semgrep/CodeQL (static analysis results)

**Benefits**:
- Automated finding import
- Bi-directional synchronization
- Unified reporting across tools
- Workflow automation

### Web Dashboard for Memory Visualization
**Status**: Planned

Web-based UI for visualizing and managing memories.

**Features**:
- Interactive memory graph visualization
- Relationship mapping and exploration
- Search and filter interface
- Session management dashboard
- Real-time updates
- Export/import functionality

**Technology Stack** (tentative):
- React or Vue.js frontend
- WebSocket for real-time updates
- D3.js for graph visualization
- Responsive design for mobile access

## Future Enhancements (Advanced Features)

As noted in ADVANCED_FEATURES.md, these capabilities build on the current foundation:

### Semantic Search with Vector Embeddings

**Status**: Planned

Enhanced backup and restore capabilities.

**Features**:
- Multiple export formats (JSON, CSV, XML)
- Selective export (by session, date, category)
- Import validation and conflict resolution
- Incremental backup/restore
- Cloud storage integration

### Memory Templates
**Status**: Dataset templates exist

Expand to full template system for memory creation.

**Features**:
- Pre-defined vulnerability templates
- Custom template creation
