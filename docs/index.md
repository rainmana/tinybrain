# TinyBrain ðŸ§ 

**Security-Focused LLM Memory Storage MCP Server**

TinyBrain is a comprehensive memory storage system designed specifically for security-focused tasks like security code review, penetration testing, and exploit development. It provides an LLM with persistent, intelligent memory capabilities through the Model Context Protocol (MCP).

## Key Features

### Security-Focused Design
- **Specialized Categories**: Vulnerability, exploit, payload, technique, tool, reference, context, hypothesis, evidence, recommendation
- **Priority & Confidence Tracking**: 0-10 priority levels and 0.0-1.0 confidence scores
- **Relationship Mapping**: Track dependencies, causes, mitigations, and exploit chains
- **Task Progress Tracking**: Multi-stage security task management
- **Standards Compliance**: Aligned with OWASP, CWE, NIST, and ISO security standards

### Intelligent Memory Management
- **Context-Aware Storage**: Automatically categorizes and prioritizes information
- **Advanced Search**: Semantic, exact, fuzzy, tag-based, and relationship-based search
- **Access Tracking**: Monitors which memories are most relevant and frequently accessed
- **Context Summaries**: Provides relevant memory summaries for current tasks

### High Performance & Reliability
- **SQLite Backend**: Fast, reliable, local storage with full-text search
- **Optimized Queries**: Indexed searches and efficient relationship traversal
- **Transaction Safety**: ACID compliance for data integrity
- **Concurrent Access**: Thread-safe operations for multiple LLM interactions

### AI-Enhanced Search & Intelligence
- **Semantic Search**: AI-powered memory search using embeddings for conceptual similarity
- **Embedding Generation**: Generate embeddings for text (placeholder for AI integration)
- **Similarity Calculation**: Calculate semantic similarity between embeddings
- **Future-Ready**: Complete foundation for OpenAI, Cohere, or local model integration

## Quick Start

Get started with TinyBrain in just a few minutes:

```bash
# Method 1: Clone and build locally (recommended)
git clone https://github.com/rainmana/tinybrain.git
cd tinybrain
make install
